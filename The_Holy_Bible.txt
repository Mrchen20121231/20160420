genesis 1

1 	in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth  
2	and the earth was without form  and void  and darkness  was  upon the face of the deep  and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters  
3 	and god said  let there be light  and there was light  
4	and god saw the light  that  it was  good  and god divided the light from the darkness  
5	and god called the light day  and the darkness he called night  and the evening and the morning were the first day  
6 	and god said  let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters  and let it divide the waters from the waters  
7	and god made the firmament  and divided the waters which  were  under the firmament from the waters which  were  above the firmament  and it was so  
8	and god called the firmament heaven  and the evening and the morning were the second day  
9 	and god said  let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place  and let the dry  land  appear  and it was so  
10	and god called the dry  land  earth  and the gathering together of the waters called he seas  and god saw that  it was  good  
11	and god said  let the earth bring forth grass  the herb yielding seed   and  the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind  whose seed  is  in itself  upon the earth  and it was so  
12	and the earth brought forth grass   and  herb yielding seed after his kind  and the tree yielding fruit  whose seed  was  in itself  after his kind  and god saw that  it was  good  
13	and the evening and the morning were the third day  
14 	and god said  let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night  and let them be for signs  and for seasons  and for days  and years  
15	and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth  and it was so  
16	and god made two great lights  the greater light to rule the day  and the lesser light to rule the night   he made  the stars also  
17	and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth  
18	and to rule over the day and over the night  and to divide the light from the darkness  and god saw that  it was  good  n was very wroth  and his countenance fell  
6 	and the lord said unto cain  why art thou wroth  and why is thy countenance fallen  
7	if thou doest well  shalt thou not be accepted  and if thou doest not well  sin lieth at the door  and unto thee  shall be  his desire  and thou shalt rule over him  
8 	and cain talked with abel his brother  and it came to pass  when they were in the field  that cain rose up against abel his brother  and slew him  
9 	and the lord said unto cain  where  is  abel thy brother  and he said  i know not   am  i my brother s keeper  
10	and he said  what hast thou done  the voice of thy brother s blood crieth unto me from the ground  
11	and now  art  thou cursed from the earth  which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother s blood from thy hand  
12	when thou tillest the ground  it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength  a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth  
13 	and cain said unto the lord  my punishment  is  greater than i can bear  
14	behold  thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth  and from thy face shall i be hid  and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth  and it shall come to pass   that  every one that findeth me shall slay me  
15	and the lord said unto him  therefore whosoever slayeth cain  vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold  and the lord set a mark upon cain  lest any finding him should kill him
